# RNBO Unity Audio Plugin

*This is experimental software—use at your own risk, and know that anything in this repository could change in the future. See [Known Issues](#known-issues) below.*


Here we implement a Native Audio Plugin for Unity as well as a helper object that facilitates working with that plugin.

After following the steps below, visit the `docs/` directory to learn more about working with [RNBO in Unity](docs/INDEX.md).

You can also check out a working example of [a drumkit and a humming orb](https://cycling74-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/rnbo/unity/example-projects/RNBODrumkit.zip).

## Project organization

There are two pieces to this project.

The first piece is our **RNBOTypes** package. This contains C# code that your custom plugin 
export will reference. If you create multiple plugins, they will all reference the same **RNBOTypes** 
package.

The second piece is our [NativeAudioPlugin](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioMixerNativeAudioPlugin.html) implementation and helper script.  This contains the
adapter code you need to convert your RNBO C++ export into a plugin that you can load in Unity.

### File Structure and Building

Please make sure you are using RNBO version `1.1.1` or later. This version comes bundled by default with Max `8.5.4`.

If you are building on Windows, find the [Windows-specific notes](#building-for-windows) below. You can also find some notes that are [Android-specific](#building-for-android-including-the-quest-2) if you are using that platform (for example, to build a VR project for the Oculus Quest).

The source code of the Plugin itself is in the `src/` directory. In general use of this repository, you shouldn't need to change anything in that directory.

Some notable directories:

| Location                          | Explanation   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| src/                              | Source for the RNBO Plugin and helper object |
| RNBOTypes/  | A dependency for the built Plugin — you'll install this into your Unity Project |
| export/                           | You can create this folder and export your code here for an easy default experience |
| build/          | You can create this folder to build your Plugin package |

We use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to actually build the plugin and its package. [Export your patcher](https://rnbo.cycling74.com/learn/the-cpp-source-code-target-introduction) to a subdirectory
you make called `export` in this repo's root directory, next to the `src` directory, and if your export is called `rnbo_source.cpp`, you can run the following commands in your terminal to build with CMake. 

Start by opening a terminal in the root of this `/rnbo.unity.audioplugin` directory. Then run:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DPLUGIN_NAME="My Custom Plugin"
cmake --build .
```
If you change the name of your export from `rnbo_source.cpp` in RNBO's export sidebar, you can either change the CMake variable `RNBO_CLASS_FILE_NAME` in `CMakeLists.txt` or use the CMake flag `-DRNBO_CLASS_FILE_NAME` when you run `cmake ..`

For example:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DRNBO_CLASS_FILE_NAME="my_custom_plugin.cpp" -DPLUGIN_NAME="My Custom Plugin"
cmake --build .
```

You can also export your c++ code into and build from some other location, other than `export/` and `build/`.
You'll need to tell CMake where to find your export dir and likely also your RNBO c++ library code.
This can be useful if you want to build several unique plugins from unique RNBO exports.

For example:

```sh
mkdir build-synth
cd build-synth
cmake .. -DRNBO_EXPORT_DIR=/Users/xnor/Documents/export/simple-freq-param -DRNBO_CPP_DIR=/Users/xnor/Documents/export/simple-freq-param/rnbo -DPLUGIN_NAME="Simple Freq Param" 
cmake --build .
```

After building, you should see a folder in your `/build` directory called **My Custom Plugin**. This should contain
all you need to install it as a package in Unity.

### Building for Windows

If you are building on Windows, you may need to give a `--config` flag in the build step in order to build a Release build as opposed to a Debug build. You can do so with:

```sh
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Building for Android (including the Quest 2)

If you've installed the NDK via Unity Hub, you should be able to find it here:

* On macOS:
  * `/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/<YOUR EDITOR VERSION>/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/NDK/`
  * eg: `/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2021.3.23f1/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/NDK/`
* On Windows:
  * `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\<YOUR EDITOR VERSION>\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\AndroidPlayer\NDK`
  * eg: `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2021.3.23f1\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\AndroidPlayer\NDK`

The NDK includes a CMake **toolchain** file, which makes our life easy.
You simply provide the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`, `ANDROID_PLATFORM` and `ANDROID_ABI` settings in addition to your other CMake parameters.

The `ANDROID_PLATFORM` is the minimum Android version you would like to target.
The `ANDROID_ABI` is the CPU binary interface that your plugin should target. See [the NDK ABIs Guide](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis) for more info.

For instance, if you want to build and run on the `Oculus Quest 2`, the documentation says to use a minimum android version of `29` and `arm64-v8a` as the `ABI`. 

The example below demonstrates this with a macOS user account called `xnor`.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. \
  -DANDROID_PLATFORM=29 \
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2021.3.23f1/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
  -DRNBO_EXPORT_DIR=/Users/xnor/Documents/export/simple-freq-param \
  -DRNBO_CPP_DIR=/Users/xnor/Documents/export/simple-freq-param/rnbo -DPLUGIN_NAME="Simple Freq Param" 
cmake --build .
```

Once you've built your package, you'll probably want to build a native version so you can load the plugin in your editor, then copy that into the package you built above.

```
mkdir build-native && cd build-native
cmake .. \
  -DRNBO_EXPORT_DIR=/Users/xnor/Documents/export/simple-freq-param \
  -DRNBO_CPP_DIR=/Users/xnor/Documents/export/simple-freq-param/rnbo -DPLUGIN_NAME="Simple Freq Param" 
cmake --build .
cp -r SimpleFreqParam/Assets/Plugins/Darwin ../build/SimpleFreqParam/Assets/Plugins/
```

Then install your package into your Unity project.

#### Notes for cross compiling for Android on Windows

The NDK version I got with Unity doesn't have [CMAKE_ANDROID_EXCEPTIONS](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.22/variable/CMAKE_ANDROID_EXCEPTIONS.html), but does support `ANDROID_CPP_FEATURES`.
I have to set `-DANDROID_CPP_FEATURES=exceptions` on the commandline to build with the default, Visual Studio, generator. I have Visual Studio 2022 with the Android C++ build tools installed.
I am also able to build with the `Unix Makefiles` generator and no additional comandline alterations.
The [NDK CMake Docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/configure-cmake#call-cmake-cli) use `Ninja` on Windows.

Here is an example commandline for building with Visual Studio 2022 and the NDK I got from Unity.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DANDROID_PLATFORM=29 -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2021.3.16f1\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\AndroidPlayer\NDK\build\cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" -DRNBO_EXPORT_DIR="Z:\Documents\export\sync-cycle" -DRNBO_CPP_DIR="Z:\Documents\export\sync-cycle\rnbo" -DPLUGIN_NAME="Sync Cycle" -DANDROID_CPP_FEATURES=exceptions
cmake --build .
```

## Known Issues

* **URP and HDRP Projects**
  - Using Unity's Built-in Renderer, this plugin should run as expected in the Unity editor and in builds. However, if you are using URP or HDRP, you can expect some audio interruptions (glitching sounds) when running your RNBO plugins in-editor. This seems to be due to a current issue with the Unity Editor. However, these audio issues do not extend to builds of your game. 
  
* **Transport Memory Leak** 
  - If you create a lot of transports, they won't be deallocated, so you're better off re-using transports (rather than creating a new transport each time you need one) if you need more granular transport control than the global transport provides.

## TODO

* Support additional platforms. Currently we support MacOS, 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows, and Android (including the Quest 2).
