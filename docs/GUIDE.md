# Working with RNBO in Unity

## Getting started

Over in your Unity project, in `/Assets`, create a `/Plugins` folder and drop in your `FooBar.bundle` from the `FooBar` package. In the Inspector for the Plugin, check "Load on Startup" and then "Apply."

## Where you can load your RNBO Device

### On an Audio Mixer

Create a new Audio Mixer and add the RNBO plugin to a track as an effectâ€”for example, the "Master" track.

To hear your audio plugin in Unity, add an Audio Source Game Object and set its Output to the Master track of this Audio Mixer.
